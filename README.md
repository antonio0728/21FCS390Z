Code for CS 390Z (Introduction to Data Mining), Fall 2021

This repository has code shared with my students in CS 390Z (Introduction to Data Mining), Fall 2021, at MSU Denver. This course is an introduction to data mining, a discipline whose overall goal is to obtain knowledge through the systematic search for patterns and relationships in rather large and potentially unstructured data.  The huge amounts of data generated today are too large and complex to be processed and analyzed by traditional methods. This course aims to discuss frameworks and algorithms that can be used to transform raw data into useful information for decision making.
